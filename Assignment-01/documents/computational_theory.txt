Computational theory is the branch of computer science that deals with the theoretical aspects of computing, including algorithms, complexity theory, and the limits of computation. One of the central questions in computational theory is determining which problems are solvable by computers, and how efficiently they can be solved. This includes studying problems in P, NP, and NP-completeness.
