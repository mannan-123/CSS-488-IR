Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data. The core idea is that systems can learn from historical data and identify patterns without being explicitly programmed. Common techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
