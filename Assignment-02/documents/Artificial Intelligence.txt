Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that aims to create machines capable of intelligent behavior.
AI systems can be designed to perform tasks like visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.
